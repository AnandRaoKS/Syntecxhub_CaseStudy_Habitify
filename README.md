## Habitify - Habit Building App
Habitify is a behavior-focused habit-building app designed around identity transformation rather than simple task tracking.
## Design Intent
- Encourages identity-based growth
- Reduces decision fatigue during setup
- Builds long-term consistency through meaningful rewards
## Challenges
- Users quit habit apps after breaking streaks
- Overwhelming setup process reduces motivation
- Overwhelming setup process reduces motivation
## Solutions
- Identity first onboarding instead of manual habit creation
- Behavioral filtering to personalize timing and focus areas
- Rank based progression system that preserves highest achievements
## Process
### 1. Understanding the User
Researched why users abandon habit apps and identified emotional triggers such as guilt, inconsistency, and overwhelm.
### 2. Defining the Core Experience
Shifted focus from task-based tracking to identity-based transformation. Users first choose who they want to become before selecting habits.
### 3. Behavioral Filtering
Users select habits they want to reduce and when they are most consistent (morning, evening, night)
### 4. Reward Loop System
Introduced a rank-based system to encourage streaks and rank remains saved to prevent motivation collapse.
## Onboarding Experience

- Habit Reduction Selection (Junk food, procrastination, etc.)
- Preferred Timing Selection (Morning, Evening, Night)
## Final Screens
